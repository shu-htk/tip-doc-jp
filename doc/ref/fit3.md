# fit3
```
tip> fit3
usage: fit3 x y z [plane] [(opt)]
 do fitting to the data x,y,z by plane function.
 you should do 'plot3 x y z' before this command.
 available fitting functions:
   p[lane] : z = c0 + c1*x + c2*y
```

Fit the plane to data x, y and z after [plot3](plot3.md) command.
The fitting information is outputted to console and fitting plane is
drawn on the existing graph.
If you specify option `cp:X,Y`, the fitting information is drawn in
the graph at (X,Y).

**note)**  
> user defined fitting function is not available
