tip> mset
usage: mset v = {{v00,..,v0M},{v10,..,v1M},..,{vN0,..,vNM}}
       mset v = expression
 set mesh data v which size is N*M.
 in the expression, there should be 2 variables
 of data which size are N and M.
```

## set the mesh data using initializer list {}

for example see.  
[ex14: Making mesh arrays and write and read it](../ex/ex14.md)

## set the mesh data by expression

for example see,    
[ex13a: Plot 3D meshed surface by some functions (part.1)](../ex/ex13a.md)  
[ex13b: Plot 3D meshed surface by some functions (part.2)](../ex/ex13b.md)
