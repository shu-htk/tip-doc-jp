# tip - tiny interactive plot

Tip is a command-line based data plotting tool.
It is written in C++ and depends on the library of
[PLPLOT](https://plplot.sourceforge.net/),
and [GNU readline](https://cgit.git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/readline.git).

Although it has fewer functions than existing plotting tools,
it just aims ease of use over versatility.
